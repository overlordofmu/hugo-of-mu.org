This is my new "about me" site. It's hosted on an [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux) system using [Nginx](http://nginx.org/) and (as noted in the footer) using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a theme named [Nix](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-nix/) provided by one [LordMathis](https://github.com/LordMathis). The ```of-mu.org``` domain, itself is registered via [Gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net/) which is a wonderful domain registrar and the only place I will register my personal domains.

Some of the more "web savvy" of you may noticed a green lock in your address bar indicating that this a "secure" site with SSL/TLS enabled. The site encryption is done using only secure cyphers so if you get errors connecting on an older browser, that is likely why.

The TLS certificate is provided for free as part of the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) project and installed using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/). Certbot is, itself, a tool created by the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/). With these tools and following the [Arch Linux wiki's 'Let's Encrypt' guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Let%E2%80%99s_Encrypt) my site received an "A+" rating from SSL Labs (as last checked on 2017-09-29).

You can test this site yourself (or any other for that matter) at SSL Labs [here](https://ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=of-mu.org&latest). Please feel free to email me (using the link on the start/index page) if SSL Labs gives this site's TLS configuration anything less than A+.

Please also note, the EFF is one of my favorite non-profits because of the amazing work they do to protect our digital freedoms. They can always use [donations](https://supporters.eff.org/donate).

Arch Linux also accepts [donations](https://www.archlinux.org/donate/) as does the parent non-profit which it is a part of: [Software in the Public Interest](http://www.spi-inc.org/).

Finally, I would like to give a shout out to my eldest child: Today, this site has more than one page and now supports the posting of blog updates. Are you happy now, Nevin? :P
